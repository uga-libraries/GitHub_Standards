# UGA Libraries GitHub Standards

## Overview

These standards and resources promote the creation of repositories for code and documentation at the UGA Libraries that are understandable and maintainable. 
These must be followed by the Digital Stewardship unit for repositories that are central to the daily work of the unit.
All other contributors to the UGA Libraries' GitHub are encouraged to follow these as well.

## Repository Contents

- [Code README Standard](Code_README_Standard.md): template for a README for a repository for code
- [Coding Resources](Coding_Resources.md)
- [Collaborative Development Workflow](Collaborative_Development_Workflow.md)
- [Documentation README Standard](Documentation_README_Standard.md): template for a README for a repository for documentation
- [GitHub Procedures](GitHub_Procedures.md): how to use different features of GitHub and GitLab
- [Repository_Standard](Repository_Standard.md): minimum required and additional recommended features for a repository

## History

First developed in 2023 by the Digital Stewardship Unit (Adriane Hanson, Corey Schmidt, Emmeline Kaser)
to consolidate our GitHub practices after a few years of maintaining code and documentation in GitHub.
