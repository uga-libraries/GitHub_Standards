## Archive/Delete a Repository 

If you are no longer using or maintaining code, you may want to archive or delete it. 
In most cases, archive the repository so we have a record of the past project. 
This will make the repository read-only and it will be clear that it is no longer being maintained. 

You might delete a repository if: 

- There are security risks with keeping the repository publicly available. These risks could include: 
  - Sensitive code like internal URLs, usernames, passwords 
  - Packages prone to security risks (requests, lxml, others) 
- The repository is minimal, meaning there isnâ€™t much code or involved processes. 
- The code lives somewhere else that is being updated/monitored.

### How to Archive a Repository 

Archiving a repository will make it read-only.
Prior to archiving, update the README with the status of the project and why it was archived.
