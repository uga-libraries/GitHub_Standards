# Overview
This section should describe what this script/repository does, what is its purpose, and what the user should expect. 
It should be around three to five sentences in length. For repositories that are a collection of scripts with no 
unified purpose, describe what each script does briefly.
# Getting Started
## Dependencies
Provide a list of packages or external libraries required for this code to run or direct a user to the requirements.txt
file. Give an example of how to install the dependencies. 
## Installation
This section should explain how a user can download the code, install any dependencies (like packages or external
libraries, can also reference the requirements.txt file if available), set up any configurations (like API keys or 
logins), and run the code.
## Workflow
Generally describe how the program works from start to finish. Generally include expected inputs, how the code processes
data or goes through the workflow, and expected outputs. 
## Testing
Detail how a user or developer can test the code to make sure it is running as intended. This can include a link to 
external testing documentation or a list of step-by-step instructions.

has a person to reference for questions.
# Acknowledgements
A bullet-point list of any person, community, or resource who assisted in the making of this repository. This can also 
be the place to describe previous repositories or workflows that influenced the making of this repository.
