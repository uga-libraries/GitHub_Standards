# Collaborative Development Workflow

## Overview 

This workflow supports collaborative development of scripts by Librariesâ€™ employees who are not full-time developers. 
It adapts concepts from agile methodology to the situation where everyone is working on the project intermittently, 
to keep momentum and support communication. 

In the context of the Digital Stewardship unit, born-digital archiving workflows can be enhanced through scripting, 
and efficient development of the more involved scripts require consistent blocks of time. 
In those cases, the Digital Archivist acts as the product owner and Head of Digital Stewardship as the primary developer. 
When time allows, the Digital Archivist also assists with development. 
After the development cycle, the two have shared responsibility for ongoing maintenance.
