# Title

## Overview
A brief description of the workflow documented in the repository, including any other repositories that the documentation references. It can also include a list of goals that the workflow accomplishes. 

Example:
> Processing actions are defined here as processes that prepare born-digital archives for ingest into permanent digital preservation storage and subsequent researcher access. Processing begins after all digital components in a collection are accessioned and appraised.
> 
> This documentation references Python scripts in the accessioning-scripts repository in the UGA Libraries GitHub.
> 
> Goals: 
> 1. Create a processing plan. 
> 2. Arrange material into AIPs. 
> 3. Address any imminently at-risk formats, if necessary.

## Repository Contents
A bulleted list of files in the repo. It serves as a table of contents with brief descriptions of the files as needed.

## Procedure Overview (Optional)
A step-by-step, numbered workflow. 

This section should include links to any relevant scripts and, as needed, can link to more in-depth markdown files for complex sub-processes within the workflow. For example, the step "Generate an initial file manifest" may link to another markdown file that includes granular steps for running any relevant scripts and cleaning up the resulting logs.

Separate documents should also be created when contextual or background info is needed for a certain process. These files should be saved to the same documentation repo.

## Documentation Produced (Optional)
A bulleted list of the documentation produced by the workflow. This section may or may not be relevant depending on the process.

## History (Optional)
A narrative section including any relevant institutional context for the workflows, information about the workflow's history and development, its authors, and the roles responsible for it. For any collaborators outside the institution, ask before including their names in this section.

Example:
>The initial version of this workflow was completed in August 2023 by Emmeline Kaser (Digital Archivist, Digital Stewardship) and represents the processes in place starting in August 2022. This workflow draws conceptually from older documentation but supersedes those processes due to changes in technological capabilities.
