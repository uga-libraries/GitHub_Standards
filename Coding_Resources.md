# Coding Resources

Tools and learning resources used by UGA Libraries.

## [UGA Libraries GitHub](https://github.com/uga-libraries)

Any code you write that will be used for UGA Libraries should be included here. 
The default is to make it a public repository, unless there is secure information as part of the script. 
Use the standards within this repository to get the best use out of GitHub.

## [Python Editor: PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) 

Digital Stewardship folks use the editor PyCharm for Python code. 
It has a bit of a learning curve, but some very nice functionality for testing, debugging, and GitHub integration.
