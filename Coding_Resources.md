# Coding Resources

Tools and learning resources used by UGA Libraries.

## Code Repositories

### [UGA Libraries GitHub](https://github.com/uga-libraries)

Any code that is used by UGA Libraries should be included here.
It can also be used for policies and workflow document to have version control and for easy sharing outside UGA.
The default is to make it a public repository, unless there is secure information as part of the script. 
Use the standards within this repository to get the best use out of GitHub.

### [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

A user interface to make it easier to work with code locally before publishing it to GitHub.
It helps sync code between your computer and GitHub, commit changes, 
and make a pull request to add it to GitHub.

### [Galileo GitLab](https://gitlab.galileo.usg.edu/) 

Used for shared projects and hosting from Galileo. 
These projects are usually multi-repository systems built and/or hosted by Galileo systems.
Your own code projects should be in GitHub, but larger systems/projects may be here.  

## Editors

### [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

Free editor that will do some automatic syntax color-coding.

### [Python Editor: PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) 

Digital Stewardship folks use the editor PyCharm for Python code. 
It has a bit of a learning curve, but some very nice functionality for testing, debugging, and GitHub integration. 

## GitHub Actions

### [Workflow to make an EXE file](https://outlookuga.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/LibrarySCL2/EUuJfOLec25BoF4UxMRo6A0B54ODbQUO_22UaNlT1fNzVQ?e=NJkeoy)
Workflow that uses cx_Freeze and GitHub Actions to automatically generate EXE files for a user to install code on their local machine.
Internal documentation, available to UGA employees only.

## Markdown
Use Markdown to mark the style in all text documents in repositories to make them more accessible and easier to read.
- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) - table with common syntax
- [Markdown Introduction](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) - website created with Markdown to demonstrate each feature
- [Improving GitHub Profile Page Accessibility](https://github.blog/2023-10-26-5-tips-for-making-your-github-profile-page-accessible/) - written for README but applies to any document
